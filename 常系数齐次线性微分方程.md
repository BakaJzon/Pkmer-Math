$$y''+P(x)y'+Q(x)y=0$$
if $P(x)$, $Q(x)$ is constant
then function will become:
$$y''+py'+qy=0$$
It can be seen from the discussion in the previous chapter [[高阶线性微分方程#定理2]] that: 
	If their ratio is not a constant, that is, $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are linearly independent, then $y=C_{1}y_{1}+C_{2}y_{2}$ is the general solution of the equation. 
When $r$ is a constant, [[指数函数]] $y=e^{rx}$ and its derivatives only differ by a constant factor. 
Since the exponential function has this characteristic $y=e^{rx}$ to try to see if we can choose an appropriate constant r to satisfy the equation:

## Solve
求得$y'=re^{rx}$, $y''=r^{2}e^{rx}$
into homogeneous equation: $$(r^{2}+pr+q)e^{ rx }=0$$
due to $e^{ rx }\neq 0$, $r^{2}+pr+q=0$
由此可见, 只要r满足这个代数方程, 这个指数函数就是微分方程的解.
这个代数方程称为微分方程的特征方程
